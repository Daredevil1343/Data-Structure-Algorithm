# Recursion

## Key-Points:
1. Make Input Smaller (Input gets smaller automatically). How ?
	- The main point is, we perform a task, where we take a decision, and as a result our Input gets smaller. 
	- Example: We need Job, but how ? Select a good college > Learn coding etc

	-  Our primary goal is to take the decisions and out input will get small automatically.

2.  Recusrion - Decision Phase
	- Choices are Given + Decision will be taken.

### How to identify a Problem can be solved with Recursion ?
You will be given some choices, out of which you'll have to "DECIDE" one of the option. All you have to do is to make a decision whether to include or exculde the option.

### Recursive Tree
You can follow Input-Output Method.
Example:

-  Number of Branches = Number of Choices.
-  Decision we take is represented using Recursive Tree.
