/*Collatz problem

Phoebe Buffay started working for Chandler Bing and he wanted her to
 write a C++ program to generate Collatz Sequence.The rules for 
 generating Collatz sequence are:
  If n is even: n = n / 2 If n is odd: n = 3n + 1
   For example, if the starting number is 5 the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 
   It has been proved for almost all integers, that the repeated application 
   of the above rule will result in a sequence that ends in 1.

INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

The input is an integer 'n' which denotes the first term of the sequence.

As output, print the numbers in the sequence and also print the number of times the rule has to be applied in order to reach 1.
