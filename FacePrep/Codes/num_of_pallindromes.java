/* Number of palindromes
Given the number of digits find the number of palindrome till those number of digits.
A palindromic number (also known as a numeral palindrome or a numeric palindrome)
 is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. 
 Like 16461, for example, it is "symmetrical". The term palindromic is derived from palindrome,
which refers to a word (such as rotor or racecar) whose spelling is
 unchanged when its letters are reversed. Like if the digit is 2 then the answer will be 18.
  The 2 digit palindromic numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99.
  
  Note: Do not consider 0.

Sample Input:
1
Sample Output:
9
