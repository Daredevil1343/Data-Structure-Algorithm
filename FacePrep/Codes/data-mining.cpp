Data mining

In the Hogwarts University examinations conducted during the past 5 years, the toppers registration numbers were 7128, 80197128, 7678 and 6567.Rachel Green is an expert in data mining and she could easily infer a pattern in the toppers registration numbers. In all the registration numbers listed here, the sum of the odd digits is equal to the sum of the even digits in the number. She termed the numbers that satisfy this property as Probable Topper Numbers. Now, write a C++ program to find whether a given number is a probable topper number or not.
